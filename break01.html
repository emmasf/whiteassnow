        <p>on a cold winter's morning, a young Queen was sewing by her window. As she looked out on the snow, she pricked her finger and shed three drops of blood. Taken by the sight, she wished for a child with lips red as blood, skin white as snow, and hair black as the ebony window frame. </p><div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>Soon the Queen had her wish, and little Snow White was born. But during her birth the Queen died, and soon a new Queen stood in her place.</p><div class="line-break"></div><div class="line-break"></div><div class="line-break"></div><div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>The new Queen was vain and cruel, as cold as the last was warm. She possessed a magic mirror that could only speak the truth, and she regularly consulted the mirror to ensure that she was the most beautiful creature in the kingdom.</p><div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>Little Snow White grew into a beautiful girl, and a jealous rage filled the Queen’s heart. Looking upon Snow White’s fair face awoke something deep within the Queen, and she could have no peace.</p><div class="line-break"></div>
