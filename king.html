        <p>The male characters in Snow White play small roles. This is mostly a story about women passing through phases of life: a maiden becomes a mother, a child becomes a maiden, and a mother becomes a crone. The King is especially silent. He appears only once in the Grimm story and not at all in the Disney version. You would think he might notice that his wife is psychotic and his daughter is missing. </p>

<p>Indeed, the next time the Queen stood before her mirror, her blood ran cold. She remained in the shadow of Little Snow White, the fairest in all the land. The mirror told the Queen of the house in the woods and she hatched a new plan to end the girl’s life, setting out in rags with a corset designed to take Snow White’s breath away.</p><div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>Snow White did not recognize the Queen out of her fine robes. Craving nice things, she invited the woman in and asked her to help lace up the dress. The Queen pulled the laces so tight that Snow White could not breathe, and as the girl fell to the floor she ran away laughing. The dwarves returned home soon after, quickly unlaced Snow White, and begged her to be more careful.</p><div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>The Queen tried again, this time tempting the girl by offering a comb to untangle her unkempt locks. She drove the poisoned comb into Snow White’s scalp, and left feeling triumphant. But the dwarves saved her again by pulling out the comb before the poison finished its work, and again insisted that she not give in to temptation.</p>
